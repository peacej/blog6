Title: Gaming
---

I had a fun time working in the game industry.  Luckily, the four languages I speak (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English) happen to be the four most important languages in the gaming industry. I was the first-ever analyst for Google Play in Japan (covering APAC). I analyzed things like Japanese gamers' behavior.

After Google Play, I worked at Supercell, first as a marketing analyst in Japan, then as a game team data scientist at Helsinki headquarters (Clash Royale, Clash of Clans). I pioneered analytics for live ops (in-game events) and dabbled in machine learning a bit too. At that time (2016~2017), I already had dreams of using generative AI in games, but GenAI as a field barely existed at that time.

Later, when I was at Stability AI, the game industry started getting serious about using GenAI, and my team did some work for gaming/metaverse use cases, including fine-tuning of 3D asset generation models. 

I think we are just getting started, and I really look forward to AI enabling amazingly better and new types of gaming experiences (not just improving development efficiency).  That includes generating assets in the development phase (for the dev team to curate/refine/use), and also content generated during gameplay (generated by the player, by NPCs, or by the game environment).  Lots of exciting possibilities here!


On a personal note, some of my favorite games:

- Clash Royale (it's also the game I worked on the most :D )
- Nier Automata (also I love the music!!)
- Final Fantasy 7, 10, 13; FF7 Remake
- tactical RPGs: Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea 4, Triangle Strategy, Banner Saga series
- RTS: Starcraft, Command & Conquer / Red Alert
- Civilization series
- Bastion
- Monument Valley
- Cave Story (洞窟物語)

Nier Automata might be the best game of all time for me.

Also, I have a list of games I must make time for playing before I die. Somehow...must...make...time....
