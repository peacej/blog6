Title: Media Appearances
---

Most of my talks/interviews are related to generative AI. 
Most are in Japanese. 
インタビューや登壇は主に日本語で生成AIについて話しています。


On a 6-minute TV special about the Stable Diffusion image model (on TBS, Tokyo Broadcasting System), I gave an intro of how to use it and how it works. TBSで画像生成AIの紹介をしました。

In 2021, [the Governor of Tokyo randomly tweeted about me](https://twitter.com/ecoyuri/status/1397901710547251203). Basically it's an article (in the first issue of the government's Tokyo Updates publication) in which I talk about how  awesome it is to live and work in Tokyo (in [English](https://www.tokyoupdates.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en/post-219/), [日本語](https://www.tokyoupdates.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/post-224/)).

I've appeared on NHK (Japan's national broadcaster) twice to talk about GenAI. 
NHKで２回、生成AIについて話しました。

The first interview was after I delivered the keynote speech at AI EXPO TOKYO (AI・人工知能 EXPO), maybe the largest AI-focused event in Japan.

The second appearance coincided with my talk about GenAI and the media industry at Note, a major content platform in Japan. ([full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-GPFkQyt8g&t=2370s)).

Somehow I ended up on the same page as the legendary AI godfather Yoshua Bengio on the Nikkei (2023 Dec). I was talking about the importance of open model weights; unfortunately the journalist decided to change it to "open code" (a different concept) without asking me.

I was interviewed by a Hakuhodo (big ad agency) creative director on MarkeZine in 2024. We talked about GenAI in marketing and played around with some image editing.

I have also given several private talks to e.g. groups of startup founders about on topics like company strategy and product strategy related to AI, how to best make use of GenAI, etc.
