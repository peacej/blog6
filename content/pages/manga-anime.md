Title: Manga & Anime
---

I'm a big fan of manga and anime since a young age, and very excited about the possibilites for technology (especially AI) to help push these industries further. In addition to my own work, at least 3 of my angel investments are doing such work.

For now, let me just share some of my favorite anime series:

- Dandadan
- [Dorohedoro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry-jzv18fOY) (very underrated IMHO. Most people have not heard of this. Violent dark fantasy, creative world-building, mixed with comedy and great action scenes too.)
- Cyberpunk Edgerunners
- Attack on Titan 進撃の巨人
- Bleach
