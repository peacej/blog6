Title: Crypto

I've been messing around with crypto since 2013 in various ways. 
I believe crypto/blockchain provides humanity with new primitives for not just finance but also human coordination/communication and ownership. Even if 99% of projects are bad, something useful will come out of the blockchain revolution. 

Check out [my curated list of crypto resources/tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-dv-1XlpfPaT4ax6o1m65Ip8FmeXgKygueimGSWMu-c/) and my [NFT collection](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNaHOVlvN23zw4z9Ewg0o6rJmOzAQMFZqn__-bUVCq3WFG3uu6_2-SsJLE7a5yhog?key=VTk5TV9rbEtyRUg2RmZMRzl4bjdwUDdPMzhlbVB3). 

My most valuable NFT is this [Chromie Squiggle](https://chromie-squiggles.com/) which is an important part of the history of generative art. The blue favicon you can see in this browser tab is a crop of this NFT.

I published an introductory book about crypto/web3 in Japanese in May 2022, ["The Future of Money" (お金の未来)](https://gendai.ismedia.jp/list/books/gendai-shinsho/9784065282977)

I also own a CloneX. The community and the various related creative content is awesome~
