Title: Data Science

I believe that machine learning and AI will change the world. (I include the word "AI" because I believe non-ML AI will also be useful.)
Although I took a few comp sci and statistics courses in school, I'm mostly a self-taught data scientist.

Check out [my curated list of data scientist/machine learning resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezygX4X9kncocaW4f9PyjAY-6dcV_DvYbmuI2lsQ_uI/edit). 
Also, I've [prioritized the online courses that I've taken / will take](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXP0SraoGA7PV1g9j6pjEV2N6g4ZIAAjkuRvh3Je5j4/).

It's funny that, after taking "Introduction to AI" at Stanford in 2001, my conclusion was that it was a dead-end field. Basically, "AI doessn't work." 
Boy, was I wrong. I regret I didn't get back into machine learning until 2015. Better late than never. 

In 2020, I gave [a talk on document embeddings and their use in recommendation systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ipKSJBwriM&t=2s).
