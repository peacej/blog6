Title: AI art
---

AI-generated art/music is the coolest thing I have ever encountered in my life.

Check out [my curated list of AI art/music resources/tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-P58p-5yx8OXE0_0RN_D5Zg3lGqYQ88xtxOXClX5c_I/edit#). It includes a technical resources on the math and ML stuff, but also non-technical resources that anyone can use to generate art.

In 2022 August, I gave a talk on text-to-image generative models for Machine Learning Tokyo ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iTpMFJR6AtcwcOCehFBabYPUuMSq1HglcRyZgjGXOR8/edit#slide=id.p)) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdahlzTVqVc)).

I probably will start putting stuff on artstation.com as well.


Below are some of my favorite outputs curated from my use of DALL-E 2 (https://labs.openai.com/) and Stable Diffusion.

"rusty metal cyborg with a fiery dark portal to hades in the chest". I first inputted a photo of me into animefilter.com, then uploaded my anime-style face into DALL-E 2 while erasing the white space around it. (uploading photorealistic faces is not allowed.)

To generate a video of changing anime faces, I interpolated in the latent space of the [Waifu Diffusion](https://github.com/harubaru/waifu-diffusion) model (fine-tuned from [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)):
