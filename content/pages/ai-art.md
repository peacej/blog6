Title: AI art
---

AI-generated art/music is the coolest thing I have ever encountered in my life.

Since January 2023, as the founder and leader of the Japan office of Stability AI, I talked a lot about Stable Diffusion and generative AI in public (not limited to AI art). 

For example, [here is a 6-minute special about Stable Diffusion on TBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jmv22jbMPc), the Japanese TV station (June 2023). 


Check out [my curated list of AI art/music resources/tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-P58p-5yx8OXE0_0RN_D5Zg3lGqYQ88xtxOXClX5c_I/edit#). It includes both   non-technical resources that anyone can use to generate art and technical resources on the math and ML stuff.

Also, see my [AI art blog posts](https://jerrychi.com/tag/ai-art.html).

In 2022 Aug, I gave a talk on text-to-image generative models for Machine Learning Tokyo ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iTpMFJR6AtcwcOCehFBabYPUuMSq1HglcRyZgjGXOR8/edit#slide=id.p)) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdahlzTVqVc)).

In 2022 Oct, I gave a [short talk on AI Art NFTs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11HRdJKUjmtrK0AgqKcq6eULrKwbHWEfK92PmzaBbfOA/edit#slide=id.g179e6f68ae5_0_0).


Below are some of my favorite outputs curated from my use of DALL·E 2 and Stable Diffusion, mostly during 2022.

"rusty metal cyborg with a fiery dark portal to hades in the chest". I first inputted a photo of me into animefilter.com, then uploaded my anime-style face into DALL-E 2 while erasing the white space around it.

To generate a video of changing anime faces, I interpolated in a custom autoencoder latent space of the pretrained VAE latent space of the [Waifu Diffusion](https://github.com/harubaru/waifu-diffusion) model (fine-tuned from [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)). I was going to publish a paper about this but became too busy..
