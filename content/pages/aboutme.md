Title: About me
---

I'm Jerry Chi, a quadralingual (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) GenAI tinkerer living in Tokyo.

I like machine learning, generative art/music, games, and anime.

Previously, I established the Japan branch of [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), a generative AI startup, in January 2023; we built generative image and language models for the Japanese market and Japanese speakers.
Also, I have led a research team in training computer vision models and anime-style image models for [PixAI](https://pix.ai).

I grew up in Silicon Valley (Cupertino) and have lived in Seoul, Beijing, Hong Kong, Taipei, Helsinki, London, Toronto, and Philadelphia.

Here is a video of me popping while dressed as a Rirakkuma (relaxing bear).

Here are my kids. They are 1/4 Japanese and 1/4 Korean.

Often, I enjoy jumpkicking and biking on rocks.

I wish I had many break-dancing moves but I don't.

Anyway, I hope you have a nice day! ♫♫
