I'm Jerry Chi, a quadralingual (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) data scientist living in Tokyo.

I like machine learning, generative art/music, and crypto.

I grew up in Silicon Valley (Cupertino) and have lived in Seoul, Beijing, Hong Kong, Taipei, Helsinki, London, Toronto, and Philadelphia.

Here is a video of me popping while dressed as a Rirakkuma (relaxing bear).
