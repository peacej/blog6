I'm Jerry Chi, a quadralingual (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) data scientist living in Tokyo.

I like machine learning, generative art/music, and crypto.

I grew up in Silicon Valley (Cupertino) and have lived in Seoul, Beijing, Hong Kong, Taipei, Helsinki, London, Toronto, and Philadelphia.

Here is a video of me popping while dressed as a Rirakkuma (relaxing bear).

Here are my kids. They are 1/4 Japanese and 1/4 Korean.

Often, I enjoy jumpkicking and biking on rocks.

I wish I had many break-dancing moves but I don't.

I hope you have a nice day! ♫♫
